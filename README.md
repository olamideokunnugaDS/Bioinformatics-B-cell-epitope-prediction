Handling Extreme Imbalance in Bioinformatics: XGBoost vs. Neural Network for B-cell Epitope Prediction 
This project describes a full data mining activity involving the exploration of a dataset related to Linear B-cell epitopes. The objective is to predict epitopes for a real human pathogen, the protozoan parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, which causes the tropical disease Chagas. My workflow involved extensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), adequate Data Pre-Processing (DPP), and rigorous modeling/pipeline development, which included comparing models to find the best one, exploring sampling techniques to handle extreme imbalance, and hyperparameter tuning. After a comprehensive process consisting of handling several issues with the dataset, most notably its extreme imbalance, I built an XGBoost pipeline with Balanced Bagging and hyperparameters: estimator__learning_rate: 0.12, estimator__max_depth: 6, estimator__n_estimators: 150, max_features: 0.5, max_samples: 1.0, n_estimators: 25, sampler: None, at threshold: 0.10. The accuracy score was not balanced enough so trained a Deep Neural Network (DNN) model on the dataset with better accuracy results of 82.25% compared to the XGBoost with Balanced Bagging (65%).
